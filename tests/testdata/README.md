## Test Data

You can download the graph datasets used in the tests, examples, and benchmarks from Hugging Face:

- [graphina-graphs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/habedi/graphina-graphs)

Make sure that the downloaded datasets (the `txt` files) are stored in the `tests/testdata/graphina-graphs` directory.

### Using Hugging Face CLI Client

You can use [huggingface-cli](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/guides/cli) to download the data:

```shell
huggingface-cli download habedi/graphina-graphs --repo-type dataset --local-dir graphina-graphs
```

### Have a Look at the Data

You can use a tool like [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) to check out the datasets.
